Project overview

This is a 3-week project broken into three phases. You will be asked to work through the life cycle of a project brief: design, build, and client review/critique.

Each of the “project life cycle stages” is broken out as a phase of the project and you will have one week to complete each phase. In week 1, pairs will generate wireframes (hand drawn is fine) and a comp in Sketch. In week 2, pairs will switch comps with another team to build. In week 3, we will have a formal group critique of both comps and static sites lead by Lauren and Louisa.

Why do this project and why do it in this format? Because it puts you in the designer’s shoes and in the shoes of a developer who is responsible for understanding and building a comp handed to them by a designer. You will build empathy and understanding around why design/UX matters, why it is important to understand the thinking behind a layout, follow a comp to the letter, and you will be pushed to explain and defend your design choices which will reinforce that the decisions that go into creating a layout are intentional, deliberate, and important.

General Requirements:

We will be providing fonts and a color palette: you may not take liberties with them. Beyond that, take as much creative license as you like.

Your comp must have a desktop and mobile version. Be prepared to speak to your layout choices and be able to back them up. Your final live project must match the comp, be responsive, and be live on github pages.

Include a README with the repo that provides a brief overview of the project, and images of both the original comp and your version.
